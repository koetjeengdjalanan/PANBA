# Feature Specification: PANBA UX baseline ‚Äî 4-click tasks and defaulted inputs

**Feature Branch**: `002-panba-is-palo`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "PANBA is Palo Alto Network Bulk Automation, This Application has Graphical user interface using custom tkinter. PANBA is an automation application used for automating reporting or make Palo Alto Netowrk config changes in bulk! Every function in this application must be done in less then 4 click (user Interaction) everytime it is possible! Every text input from user should always have a default value no matter what it is!"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
2. Analyze and understood the existing code
   ‚Üí Always choose to use existing code than making a new one
   ‚Üí Make the absolute minimum of changes in the existing environment
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with What should I do Human?
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any Warning: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Always analyze the current code before any decision
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use the fastest method available for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a network operations user, I want to complete common reporting and bulk configuration tasks on Palo Alto Networks devices via a simple desktop interface in four or fewer clicks, with sensible defaults pre-filled, so I can work faster and reduce errors.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the user is on the application‚Äôs main screen, When they select a standard report task (e.g., device health summary) and proceed using pre-filled defaults, Then they can start the report in four or fewer clicks and the system confirms submission.
2. Given the user needs to apply a bulk configuration change to multiple devices, When they open the bulk change task from the main screen and accept pre-filled values (device set/template/scope), Then they can review and execute in four or fewer clicks, with a confirmation step included within the click budget.
3. Given a text input field is required (e.g., report name or output path), When the user focuses the field, Then it already contains a non-empty, sensible default that the user may accept or override.
4. Given previously used values exist for a task, When the user re-runs that task, Then last-used values or context-aware defaults are pre-applied to minimize clicks.

### Edge Cases
- When no safe or context-aware default can be determined for a mandatory text input, the system uses a clearly labeled system default and indicates it can be changed. Use a placeholder and make sure the inputted data is not placeholder.
- When the happy path cannot meet the four-click target due to compliance/approval steps, the system flags the task as an exception and documents rationale while still minimizing clicks. Give a thorough explanation and concise reasoning before continue.
- On first run (no history), defaults derive from environment context (e.g., user home, standard report name, detected devices) rather than empty fields. Use a placeholder and make sure the inputted data is not placeholder.
- When device connectivity or authentication fails during task execution, the system surfaces actionable error messages without holding any running process or skip it if user specify "skip on error" option then show the report which function and objects are effected.
- When the number of selected devices is very large, the system should still allow initiation within four clicks; progress and batching occur after submission. The system should always try to run in parallel using multi threading and asynchronous method.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The system MUST enable operators to perform common reporting tasks on managed Palo Alto Networks devices through a desktop user interface.
- FR-002: The system MUST enable operators to perform bulk configuration changes across multiple devices through the same interface.
- FR-003: Four-Click Rule ‚Äî For each supported task‚Äôs primary happy path, users MUST be able to complete from task entry point to execution confirmation in four (4) or fewer clicks. Every input/clicks count!
- FR-004: Defaulted Text Inputs ‚Äî Every text input field MUST present a non-empty, sensible default value when the field is first shown or focused; users MUST be able to accept or override it.
- FR-005: Default Strategy ‚Äî Defaults SHOULD be context-aware (e.g., last-used values, device inventory, safe standard names) and MUST fall back to safe system defaults when context is unavailable. Use placeholder when the context is and system defaults is missing.
- FR-006: Review & Confirmation ‚Äî If a confirmation step is required, it MUST be included within the four-click budget for the happy path.
- FR-007: Persisted Preferences ‚Äî The system MUST persist user selections that are appropriate to reuse as future defaults for the same task.
- FR-008: Error Visibility ‚Äî Validation errors MUST be clearly indicated without forcing additional required clicks to discover them (inline or immediate feedback is acceptable within the click budget).
- FR-009: Scope Control ‚Äî Users MUST be able to specify the device scope for bulk actions using pre-populated controls (e.g., previously used device sets or detected groups) while staying within the click target.
- FR-010: Non-blocking Progress ‚Äî After initiation, long-running tasks MUST provide progress/feedback without additional required clicks to keep the task running.

Ambiguities to resolve (do not implement until clarified):
- FR-A01: Supported device types and PAN-OS versions. Assume the system has the latest LTS version.
- FR-A02: Catalog of ‚Äústandard report‚Äù types and their default parameters. Excel files.
- FR-A03: Allowed bulk configuration change categories (policies, objects, interfaces, etc.) and constraints. But always do double confirmation (user confirmation on bulk changes is not consider as user input).
- FR-A04: Roles/permissions for who can initiate bulk changes vs. reports. Based on the provided user Palo Alto API Credentials.
- FR-A05: Output destinations and formats for reports (local file, network share, naming conventions). Defaulting in same folders where the application is placed in excels format.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- Device: A managed Palo Alto Networks device (attributes: identifier, hostname, group, version, reachability).
- Device Group: A logical collection of devices used to define scope for bulk operations or reports.
- Report Job: A user-initiated reporting task (attributes: report type, scope, parameters, output destination, status, timestamps).
- Change Job: A user-initiated configuration change task (attributes: change template/parameters, scope, approvals if any, status, timestamps).
- Credential Profile: A stored set of access credentials or tokens used to authenticate against devices or controllers.
- User Preferences: Persisted last-used values and presets that feed defaulting.
